I have a script that install the printer  using the printer installation dialog of the browser for test automation.

The script enters a path to the file dialog and click on the ok button.

The script runs prefect on my local machine.

I'm using Runtime.getRuntime().exec // to execute the script remotely, it opens but doing nothing, meaning no interaction is being made with the file printer installation dialog.

I use selenium and java to do this, this is the code:

  driver.findElement(By.xpath("//a[contains(.,'norprinter9')]")).click();
    Thread.sleep(3000);
    Runtime.getRuntime().exec("C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\AUTOIT\\K1.exe");
